Minecraft Tools
===============

Just a collection of random tools I've written Minecraft_ and used that aren't
quite up to being their own thing. I expect this will mostly be a collection of
python programs to construct things inside Minecraft via CanaryMod_ and
CanaryRaspberryJuicePlugin_.

Japanese House
--------------

japanese_house.py_ produces a Minecraft interpretation of a classice Japanese
house. Presently it only produces the single configuration that is little more
than an empty shell.
